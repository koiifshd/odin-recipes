        <h2>Description</h2>
        <h7>Ramen is a treasure's worth of food, being both absolutely bursting with flavor and also just being insanely delicious.</h7>
        <br>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h5>Mushrooms and Chicken</h5>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
        <li>8 oz. mushrooms</li>
        <li>1 large boneless/skinless chicken breast ~3/4 lbs.</li>
        <li>Salt/Pepper</li>
        <br>

        <h5>Soup</h5>
        <li>1/2 cup dry white wine</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, mixed</li>
        <li>6 cups low sodium chicken broth</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons low sodium soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons hot sauce</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons honey</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon toasted sesame seed oil</li>
        <li>2 (3 oz.) packets of instant Ramen Noodles</li>
        <li>6 leaves Bok Choy, roughly chopped</li>
        <br>

        <h5>Seasonings & For Serving</h5>
        <li>3/4 teaspoons each: onion powder, mustard powder</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon white pepper</li>
        <li>1 pinch red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>Green Onions</li>
        <li>Roughly Chopped Honey Roasted Peanuts</li>
        <li>Soft Boiled Eggs</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil and 1 tablespoon of butter in a large soup pot over medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms. Sauté until golden, about 4 minutes. Remove and set aside so that they retain the color, flavor, and texture.</li>
            <li>Slice the chicken in half lengthwise to create 2 thinner slices. Cover with saran wrap and use the textured side of a meat mallet to pound it to ½ inch thick.</li>
            <li>Pat the chicken dry and season each side with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Heat remaining olive oil and butter in a large soup pot over medium-high heat. Sear the chicken in batches for 4-5 minutes per side, until a golden crust has developed. Set aside turn the heat off. Let the chicken rest for 10 minutes, then cut into strips of desired size.</li>
            <li>Add the wine and set the heat to medium. Use a silicone spatula to “clean” the bottom and sides of the skillet. Let the wine bubble gently and reduce by half, 4-5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the butter and garlic and cook for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the chicken broth, soy sauce, hot sauce, honey, sesame oil, and soup seasonings. Bring to a gentle boil and let the broth reduce and concentrate for 10 minutes while you soft boil eggs for serving (see notes for instructions).</li>
            <li>Bring the soup to a more rapid boil, add the Ramen, and cook for 1 minute. Reduce to a gentle simmer and add the Bok Choy along with the cooked mushrooms and chicken. Simmer until the noodles are done, about 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Transfer to serving bowls and top with green onions, roughly chopped peanuts, and a soft-boiled egg.</li>
        </ol>
