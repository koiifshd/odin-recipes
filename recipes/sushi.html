        <ls>1/4 cup water</ls>
        <ls>2 tsp rice vinegar</ls>
        <br>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <ls>Gather all the ingredients.</ls>
            <ls>Cut 1 Japanese or Persian cucumber lengthwise into quarters. Remove the seeds and then again cut in half lengthwise into thin strips. You will have 8 strips.</ls>
            <ls>Cut 2 avocados in half lengthwise around the pit and twist the halves until they separate. Use a spoon to remove the pit.</ls>
            <ls>Remove the skin and thinly slice the avocado halves crosswise.</ls>
            <ls>Gently press the avocado slices with your fingers so the individual slices begin to slide and separate. Keep pressing gently and evenly with the side of the knife until the length of the sliced avocado half is about the length of a sushi roll (or a sheet of nori seaweed.)</ls>
        </ol>
        <br>

        <h5>Sushi Rolling!</h5>
        <ol>
            <ls>Make the vinegared water by combining 1/4 cup water and 2 tsp rice vinegar in a small bowl. Then, take a bamboo mat and line it with plastic wrap. Place half of a seaweed sheet with the shiny side down, and then dip your hands the the vinegared water and spread 3/4 cup of sushi rice on the nori sheet.</ls>
            <ls>Flip over the nori sheet with the rice on it and then place two pieces of shrimp tempura lengthwise along the bottom edge of the nori sheet closest to you. Then add 1/2 tbsp of flying fish roe with 2 cucumber strips.</ls>
            <ls>Start at the bottom end and roll the nori sheet over the filling tightly and firmly until the bamboo mat is completely rolled up. Lift up the bamboo mat and roll over the remaining nori.</ls>
            <ls>Place the bamboo mat over the top and tightly squeeze the roll.</ls>
            <ls>Remove the sushi roll from the bamboo mat and the plastic wrap. Use the side of a knife and lift the avocado slices from half of an avocado and place them onto the top of the roll. If you want to add freshwater eel fillet, alternate avocado and freshwater eel fillet and layer them on the top and sides of the roll.</ls>
            <ls>Put the plastic wrap and bamboo mat over the roll again. Tightly squeeze the roll through the bamboo mat until the avocado slices wrap around the roll. Also be gentle however in order not to break the avocado slices. Then, remove the mat.</ls>
            <ls>Cut the resulting Dragon Roll through the plastic wrap into 8 pieces with the knife. After each cut, clean the knife with a wet towel. If the sushi starts to get messy, tightly squeeze the sushi roll again with the bamboo mat. Remove the plastic wrap on to of the sushi and transfer the sushi pieces to a serving plate.</ls>
            <ls>Repeat to make the other 3 rolls.</ls>
        </ol>
        <br>

        <h5>To Serve or Store!</h5>
        <ls>To serve, put some tobiko on each piece of sushi and drizzle some spicy mayo and black sesame seeds on top. If you want, you can also put some eel sauce on the plate for dipping!</ls>
        <ls>To store, keep them in a cool place for 8 hours. If you want to refrigerate them, cover them with a thick kitchen towel so the rice won't become actually cold. If you have leftover sushi rice, you can store that in an airtight container in the freezer for about one month. You can then defrost it overnight in the fridge and them microwave it to around room termperature. </ls>
